Aim:Kimmba Bilingual Early Learning Centre is the first long day care service in Australia that offers 4 languages spontenously to children daily. It’s multilingual program aims at the acceptance of families and children who come from different nationalities and backgrounds and who speak different languages because we believe that a society that accepts its peoples’ colours, races, languages, and even religions, is a successful, well-functioning society and one in which we would like our children to live and grow. As migrants, we would like to see multiculturalism in Australia continue to succeed and in doing so promote the diversities of the world’s cultures without any language barriers.
