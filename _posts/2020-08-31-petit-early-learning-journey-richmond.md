<em>Encouraging your child’s innate potential and thriving personality are essential during the pre-school and kindergarten years. Preparing for their school years is also fundamental. Through play-based learning and structured learning times, we help pre-schoolers and kindergarteners thrive and flourish. In pre-school, children continue to form important language, social and cognitive abilities.</em>
