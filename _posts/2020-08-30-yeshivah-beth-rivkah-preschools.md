Aim:Our Pre-Schools aim to develop the “whole person”, and as such provide a balance of social, religious and general studies as well as life skills, to promote the child’s complete personal development. 
The overall philosophy of the centre is based on the Lubavitch Chassidic philosophy and is further developed in collaboration with staff, families, and management. Essential to the Centre philosophy is the need to maintain a warm, positive and co-operative environment in which students can grow and learn. Such a nurturing environment is deemed vital for the development of self-esteem, and confidence.
