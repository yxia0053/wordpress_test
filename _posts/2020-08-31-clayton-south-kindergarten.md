<strong>Activities Provided</strong>

We provide opportunities for learning language and literacy by providing experiences that promote discussions, through books, drawing and writing and games that include letters and numbers. We encourage children’s creativity through drama, puppets and discussions about numerous topic and concepts. The children in our kindergarten community have various language experiences and these activities assist with language development and learning English, so children can express their own experiences in their multicultural home and social settings in their home language and English.
