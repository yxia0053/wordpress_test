<em>With a commitment to "raising the bar" in early education the team at Little Patch work tirelessly to deliver exceptional quality care and education for every child, every day. Our educational philosophies are underpinned by the widely respected Reggio Emilia approach to learning which supports enquiry and play-based learning experiences in natural and responsive environments. Our learning programs are designed to be emergent in nature and, through reflective practices, are guided by the childrenâ€™s interests and needs.</em>
