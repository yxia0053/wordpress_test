Board Puzzle

Babies:
Taking the puzzle pieces out will be the first skill that infant will master quite easily.&nbsp;Banging the puzzle pieces together or on the floor is also a lot of fun because it makes a lot of noise, which infants love. Let the infant explore how to identify and scan the puzzle piece and the outline of the hole where it belongs.&nbsp; Observe how the infant matches the picture of the puzzle piece and the hole where it belongs. Encourage children by talking and referring to the colors and shapes of the puzzle.

toddler:
Caregiver explains that puzzle pieces come in different shapes and sizes.&nbsp; Some pieces have bumps with rounded corners.&nbsp;Ask a child or a group of children to complete the puzzle; ask them to memorize where each piece fits.&nbsp;Form a group of children and challenge them to complete the puzzle as fast as they can. Everyone should participate in completing the puzzle.

Chain Puzzle

Babies:
Place the individual pieces in front of the baby. Let her reach for and hold the puzzle pieces. Can she hold one in each hand? Clap them together. Listen to the sound. Talk to the baby about the different colors in the puzzle. Hide one of the puzzle pieces under a cloth. Talk about what you are doing. Ask the baby to find it. She will have fun lifting the cloth and showing you how much she knows! Put the puzzle together as the baby watches. Make up a story about the puzzle. Does it look like a boat? or a bird? Where is it going?

toddler:
Let the children play freely, taking the puzzle apart and putting it back together again. Talk about the colors of each piece. Can you find the red one? Let add the green one to the chain. Talk about the different colors in your clothes. What color is the child wearing? Count each piece as the child completes the chain puzzle. Make a chain of three pieces. Point to and say the number of each piece as you play.&nbsp;Repeat this many times, making chains of different sizes. Try making up a counting song or color rhyme about the puzzle.

Board Book

Babies:
Talk to infants as much as you can. Listen to all the sounds infants make and talk back to them. Talk about the pictures they see in the book, help them turn the pages. As you look at the pictures, talk about what you see. hat do you think comes next?

preschool:
Sit in a group and display the board books in front of children.&nbsp; Ask children what they see and what they can find in the pictures in the books.&nbsp; Ask children to point to some of the pictures. If the children cannot show you, try to find the pictures together.&nbsp; Ask the children to tell a story about the pictures, or to say what they think about them.&nbsp; Ask the children to find and name objects in their environment that look like the pictures.

Paper and Crayons:

babies:

If they cannot find them, show them and ask the children again to find them.

Sponge Balls:

Ask children to find another domino with the same number of dots on one side

perschool:
Games help children learn about numbers. Here is one to try. Sit in a circle and give each player five dominoes. Put the rest in a pile in the middle of the circle. The first player puts down one of his dominoes. The next player must attach a domino to the one in the middle matching the number of dots. If he can make a match, he takes a domino from the pile.

Memory Game:

Place all cards face down. Each player then picks two and turns them over so other players can see the face and where the card is located on the table. If they do not match, cards are placed face down again in the same location and the next player takes a turn. If they do match, the player keeps the pair. As the game is played, everyone sees the images on each card and their location, and players can begin to memorize where the matching cards are on the table. They can then choose matching pairs of cards from memory and keep the pairs that they match. The player with the most matching cards wins. Let the children dump all the cards in a pile and play with them. Ask children what cards they like the most and why. Encourage children to talk about the pictures of the cards and let them play with the cards freely
